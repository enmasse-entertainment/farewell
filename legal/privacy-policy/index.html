                        <h3 id="info-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h3>
              
                        <p>The information we collect depends on which service you use and how you use them. We collect two types of information; “personal information” that identifies you as a specific individual and “non-personal information” that doesn’t. The particular kinds of personal and non-personal information we collect usually depend on how you interact with us. The controller of the personal information collected is En Masse Entertainment, Inc., 1218 3rd Ave. Suite 800, Seattle, WA. 98101, USA.</p>
              
                        <h4>A. Information You Give Us Directly</h4>
                        <p>We collect information you provide us, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Your email address and password;</li>
                        <li>Security questions and answers;</li>

                        <li>Information you provide when seeking help from us such as your nickname or user-number and records of the issues you experience;</li>
                        <li>Demographic details, for instance in response to surveys about our services; and</li>
                        <li>Information you provide to enter a contest or sweepstakes. If you win, we may need to collect your social security number, postal address and/or national identification for eligibility, prizes delivery and tax purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
              
                        <p>When you participate in social features (such as chat), the information that you disclose is public information. We may store and access it, and it may be read, copied, collected or used by other users without your consent. Please make sure your privacy settings reflect your preferences.</p>
              
                        <p>When you participate in online multi-play games, your in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics are visible to all. We may record your gameplay, including your controller button inputs, and replay these together with your profile information and game statistics to other players in-game without further notice to you, for example as part of a spectator mode, or for out-of-game promotional purposes.</p>

                        <h4>C. Advertisement Serving Technologies</h4>
                        <p>Some of our services employ advertisement serving technologies that use cookies and other similar technologies like identifiers to deliver offers to you.
